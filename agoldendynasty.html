          The Golden State Warriors have been around since the NBA's inception. After winning championships in 1947, 1956 and 1975, the team hadn't found much success since. But the team's lucked turned for the better during the 2014 - 2015 NBA Season, when the Warriors would shock the basketball world by winning their first title in 40 years. This season spearheaded a dominant 4 year stretch -- winning two more titles in the process, in what many would consider one, if not THE greatest dynasties in basketball's history. We will take a deep dive into this momentous run, and find out how good they really are, and how they match up against established dynasties of old.

          After having been a lottery team for many years, the Warriors' luck seem to have turned around. In 2010, Joe Lacob and Peter Guber bought the organization for $450 million, signifying a change within the organization. The following year, Mark Jackson was annouced as the new head coach. Since taking over the helm, the team has seen significant improvement, making the playoffs in Jackson's 2nd and 3rd year as head coach.

          But then, in a shocking turn of events, especially with the team's drastic improvement, the Warriors' brass decided to oust Mark Jackson and replace him with Steve Kerr. Change was felt instantly as the team's performance skyrocketed. With Kerr now at the help, the team was able to snag 2 championships in his first 3 years with the team.
